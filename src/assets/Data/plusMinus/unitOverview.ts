"<h2> Plus and Minus! </h2> <p> In this unit we will be learning on how to solve simple equations, the hardest equations will be, -2 - 6 = ?. </p> <p> n mathematics, a linear equation is an equation that may be put in the form In other words, a linear equation is obtained by equating to zero a linear polynomial over some field, from which the coefficients are taken (the symbols used for the variables are supposed to not denote any element of the field). The solutions of such an equation are the values that, when substituted for the unknowns, make the equality true. In the case of just one variable, there is exactly one solution (provided that {\displaystyle a_{1}\neq 0}{\displaystyle a_{1}\neq 0}). Often, the term linear equation refers implicitly to this particular case, in which the variable is sensibly called the unknown. In the case of two variables, each solution may be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinates of a point of the Euclidean plane. The solutions of a linear equation form a line in the Euclidean plane, and, conversely, every line can be viewed as the set of all solutions of a linear equation in two variables. This is the origin of the term linear for describing this type of equations. More generally, the solutions of a linear equation in n variables form a hyperplane (a subspace of dimension n âˆ’ 1) in the Euclidean space of dimension n. Linear equations occur frequently in all mathematics and their applications in physics and engineering, partly because non-linear systems are often well approximated by linear equations. This article considers the case of a single equation with coefficients from the field of real numbers, for which one studies the real solutions. All of its content applies to complex solutions and, more generally, for linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any field. For the case of several simultaneous linear equations, see system of linear equations.  </p>"
